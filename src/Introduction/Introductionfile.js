  <h1>Demystifying HTML: The Building Blocks of the Web</h1>
  <p>Ever wondered what goes behind the scenes of the websites you visit? The answer lies in a fundamental language called HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language.</p>

  <h2 className="text-success">What Does HTML Do?</h2>
  <p>HTML acts as the skeleton of a web page. It defines the structure and content, telling web browsers how to display elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Imagine it as the blueprint for your web page, outlining the different sections and their organization.</p>

  <h2 className="text-success">How Does HTML Work?</h2>
  <p>HTML utilizes tags, which are special keywords wrapped in angle brackets '&lt;' and '&gt; . These tags instruct the browser on how to interpret the content between them. For instance, the &lt;h1&gt; tag defines a heading, while the &lt;p&gt; tag signifies a paragraph.</p>
  

  <h2 className="text-success">Beyond Text: Images and Links</h2>
  <p>HTML isn't limited to text alone. It allows you to embed images using the `<img/>` tag and create hyperlinks with the `<a/>` tag. Hyperlinks connect web pages, enabling users to navigate seamlessly through websites.</p>
