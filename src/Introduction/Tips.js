      <h1>HTML Tips for Beginners</h1>
      
      <h2 className="text-success">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
        Whether you're just starting out or looking to improve your HTML skills, these tips will help you write cleaner, more efficient code and build better web pages.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-success">1. Use Semantic HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Semantic HTML tags provide meaning to the content, making it easier for both humans and search engines to understand.
        Instead of using generic `&lt;div&gt;` or &lt;span&gt; tags, consider using semantic tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.
        This improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-success">2. Structure Your Content</h2>
      <p>
        Properly structuring your HTML content is essential for creating well-organized web pages.
        Use headings (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) to outline the hierarchy of your content, with &lt;h1&gt; as the main heading and &lt;h2&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; for subheadings.
        Group related content within &lt;section&gt; or &lt;div&gt; elements, and use &lt;article&gt; for standalone content units.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-success">3. Keep It Simple</h2>
      <p>
        Avoid unnecessary complexity in your HTML code.
        Write clear and concise markup by using only the necessary elements and attributes.
        Don't overuse inline styles or inline JavaScript.
        Instead, separate your concerns by using external CSS for styling and external JavaScript for behavior.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-success">4. Validate Your HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Always validate your HTML code to ensure it complies with the official HTML specifications.
        Use online validation tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service to check for syntax errors, missing tags, or deprecated attributes.
        Valid HTML improves cross-browser compatibility and ensures a consistent user experience across different devices.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-success">5. Learn and Experiment</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is a versatile language with many features and capabilities.
        Take the time to learn new HTML elements, attributes, and best practices.
        Experiment with different layouts, structures, and techniques to expand your skillset and create unique web experiences.
        Don't be afraid to explore and push the boundaries of what's possible with HTML.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-success">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        By following these HTML tips for beginners, you'll be well on your way to becoming a proficient web developer.
        Remember to use semantic HTML, structure your content logically, keep your code simple and clean, validate your HTML, and continue learning and experimenting.
        With practice and dedication, you'll master HTML and be able to create stunning web pages that stand out on the internet.
